HumaDat Platform 


Developed for medical researchers where the capture of human physiological data is required to facilitate a study. The 'HumaDat' is a data capture device that utilises various sensors to capture human physiological data at a granular level over a period of a day. Data can then be transferred to the companion application. Data will be processed on the companion application to provided initial data analytics alongside the raw data to the user. This device is different from devices like smart watches as it's design will allow access to raw data channels alongside pre-processed ones allowing researchers to perform more additional analytics where the sensors can provide further data. This contrasts with many smart watches where the raw data is often obscured from the customer.
